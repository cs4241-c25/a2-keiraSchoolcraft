## Fitness Tracker https://a2-keiraschoolcraft.glitch.me/
This fitness tracker is designed to hold rowing workouts (or really any metered workout) and will collect your heartrate, the duration of the activity, and the meters rowed. With this information it will calculate the calories burned and assign a HR zone. 
This tracker uses the "flex" positioning technique, mostly because I wanted a nice way to position everything column-wise and center it all in the middle.
To use the fitness tracker, the user must input ALL fields. If the user wishes to delete the last entry, they need only hit "delete last entry" and submit the form.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using javascript in main.js, I was able to use innerHTML to update the form and display it on the main page of the website, so the user can see it update in real time.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Again, not sure if this counts, but I also added an event listener upon submit in main.js that handled everything with the post/get. This allows the table to update in real time without having to refresh the page.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I added a fun text animation. I'm not sure this counts as an achievement but I had a good time doing it. The font grows and pulses, as does the input number box. It goes from white to red, and pulses in both directions.
